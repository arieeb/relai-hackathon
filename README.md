## 🚀 Problem Statement

Gen Z is always connected — but meaningful conversations still fade.

Between academics, internships, side projects, and social life, important relationships suffer due to:

- Delayed replies  
- Forgotten follow-ups  
- Missed important mentions  
- Buried plans  
- Long inactivity gaps  

The problem isn’t communication access — it’s the lack of intelligent automation around it.

**RelAI analyzes communication patterns and proactively suggests meaningful social actions before relationships weaken.**
